# Searching Algorithms

## Binary Search

Idea ressembles a dictionary lookup. We can use binary search whenever you make a binary decision to shrink the search range.

## Where can we use binary search?

1. If a sorted list and a target is provided.
2. If only a target is provided and to obtain the solution, you can create your own sorted list.
3. If only a half sorted list is provided and the solution is the target.
4. If you can get to a state where the list is strictly increasing or decreasing.
5. A range in a specific order, also counts a valid pattern for binary search.
