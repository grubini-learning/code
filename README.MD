# Problem Solving

The goals of these sub folders is to practice a structured problem solving approach.

## Systematic approach

- Issues

  - Not understand the problem
  - Keep it simple not fancy

- Steps to Nirvana “70% of the time is spent on steps 1 - 3”
  - Read the problem completely twice
    - Can you explain the problem to someone else?
    - Look for corner cases?
  - Trace manually with 3 sets of data
  - Optimize manual steps
  - Write manual steps as pseudo code
  - Replace pseudo code with real code
  - Optimize real code

### Steps:

1. Issue:
2. Input/Output
3. Constraints:
4. Edge cases:
5. Ideas
6. Traces:
7. Manual steps
8. Pseudo code
9. Optimize
