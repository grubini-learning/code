# Tuples

These have similar to the operations from lists, but they are immutable

## Use cases

If we are dealing with a sequence of objects and we want to make sure that we don't accidentally modify the sequence

Read only list

```python
point = (1, 2)

or

point 1, 2

or

point = 1,

or

point = ()
```

## Converting

`tuple([1, 2])` - we can convert a list to a tuple
