# Modules

They are like sections or departments in a grocery store, where all related things are grouped and packaged

A module is a file

## How to decide what function or class to put in a module

Contains highly related objects

## Two ways to import from a module

No performance difference because either way python loads the entire module

```python
from sales import [name of what you want to import]

import sales

sales.calc_shipping()
```
